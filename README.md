# Go Movies CRUD

This project is to demonstrate how to use gorilla/mux to create API routes and handler. 
It also show how to get request data. Data is not persisted to any permanent database. Data is persisted in memory.
Stil, it's a starting point for anyone who is trying to build a microservice with golang.
Thank You
